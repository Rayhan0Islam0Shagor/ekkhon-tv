This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a demo website where I use Next.js to create a simple blog. I use the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) as a guide to create this website. I also use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the website.
